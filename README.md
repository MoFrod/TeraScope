# CSC8634_TeraScope_210431461

Welcome to my coursework for CSC8634!

This file introduces you to the coursework, which I've chosen to call 'TeraScope' as that's the name provided by Newcastle University for a cloud (super)computer that renders terapixels across 1024 GPUs.

I have used ProjectTemplate, which is an R package that helps you organise your statistical analysis projects. To load this project, first you'll need to get the files from me or simply pull the code from GitHub (the data is not included). You then need to setwd() into the directory where this README file is located. In my computer it's called 'CSC8634_TeraScope_210431461'

Please start by opening the Rmarkdown file in the reports folder called 'CSC8634_TeraScope-Report'. Running the code from this will make sure that you get off to a great start!

You'll also see that I have:

- set up the configuration and listed the R packages used in config;

- stored the datasets in data and they've loaded into cache;

- put preprocessing code in munge;

- included useful code (well... I found it useful) in src;

- saved the visualisations created in graphs;

- stored my report, abstract and bibliography in reports.

Once that's done, you can have fun exploring what I've done, and build on it by executing any code you'd like. For new analysis you create, I'd recommend putting a separate file in the src directory.
